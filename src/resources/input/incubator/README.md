Experiment run by Hao.
The desired temperature was set to 35 (corresponding the UL). And the LL is 30.

exp1_ht3_hg2: Heating time is 3 seconds, and heating gap is 2.
exp1_ht30_hg20: Heating time is 30 seconds, and heating gap is 20.

2P_model: two parameters model.
4P_model: four parameters model.
